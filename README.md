## Pygame Installation 
Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from python.org. Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
To see if it works, run one of the included examples:

```
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```
### Run the code

Enter the following to run the code.

```
cd code
python3 connect_4_using_RL.py
```
